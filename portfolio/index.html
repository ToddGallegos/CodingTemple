                <h2>CAREER PHASE ONE:</h2>
                <h4>Respiratory Therapy</h4>

                <p>The first phase of my career was in healthcare as a Respiratory Therapist. 
                    After earning a degree in Respiratory Care in 2009, I went to work at a 
                    rural hospital in northern California and was responsible for putting 
                    patients on various types of life-sustaining machines, evaluating the 
                    breathing of every high-risk newborn as they're delivered and intervening 
                    when necessary, administering breathing treatments to patients with asthma 
                    or COPD, and countless other therapies.  The joy of bringing comfort to people 
                    that were going through some of the most difficult moments of their lives was 
                    incredibly fulfilling, but being around so much death eventually takes it's 
                    toll and leads to emotional fatigue, or burnout.  And so it was that after 
                    over a decade as a Respiratory Therapist, I decided to retire my stethoscope 
                    and begin a new career as a Software Engineer.</p>

                <h2>CAREER PHASE TWO:</h2>
                <h4>Computer Programming</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img class="main-pics" src="programming.jpg" alt="Computer screens filled with code."> 
                    <figcaption>A Software Engineer hard at work.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I started my computer programming career by enrolling in three classes at my local 
                    college: Introduction to Programming, Programming and Algorithms I, and Web Development. 
                    These three classes allowed me to understand the fundamentals of Python, Go, HTML, and CSS. 
                    Before the end of the semester I had switched to Codecademy's Pro courses and begun going 
                    the self-taught route. I quickly earned certificates in HTML, CSS, Introduction to JavaScript, 
                    Intermediate JavaScript, Command Line Interface, and Git/GitHub. I then enrolled in their 
                    Front End Developer course and eventually completed 60% of the class before my progress stalled 
                    for good. At that point I knew that I needed help. Some sort of curriculum to follow which was 
                    curated by a seasoned programmer and includes everything I'll need to be job-ready. Not to 
                    mention the desperate need of accountability, motivation, and a peer-group to learn alongside. 
                    Hence, the journey of my entire life leading to this path...the path to Coding Temple. 
                    It is here that I will complete my training and finally reach my final form as a professional 
                    Software Engineer / Web Developer / Computer Programmer / Coder / why do we have so many names?</p>
