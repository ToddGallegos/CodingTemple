          <h4>Respiratory Therapy</h4>

            The first phase of my career was in healthcare as a Respiratory
            Therapist. After earning a degree in Respiratory Care in 2009, I
            worked at a couple hospitals in northern California where I was
            responsible for putting patients on various types of life-support
            machines, evaluating the breathing of every high-risk newborn as
            they're delivered and intervening when necessary, administering
            breathing treatments to patients with asthma or COPD, and countless
            other therapies. The joy of bringing comfort to people that were
            going through some of the most difficult moments of their lives was
            incredibly fulfilling, but being around so much death eventually
            takes it's toll and leads to emotional fatigue, or burnout. And so
            it was that after over a decade as a Respiratory Therapist, I
            decided to retire my stethoscope and begin a new career as a
            Software Engineer.

            I started my computer programming career by enrolling in three
            classes at my local college: Introduction to Programming,
            Programming and Algorithms I, and Web Development. These three
            classes allowed me to understand the fundamentals of Python, Go,
            HTML, and CSS. Before the end of the semester I had switched to
            Codecademy's Pro courses and begun going the self-taught route. I
            quickly earned certificates in HTML, CSS, Introduction to
            JavaScript, Intermediate JavaScript, Command Line Interface, and
            Git/GitHub. I then enrolled in their Front End Developer course and
            eventually completed 60% of the class before my progress stalled for
            good. At that point I knew that I needed help. Some sort of
            curriculum to follow which was curated by a seasoned programmer and
            includes everything I'll need to be job-ready. Not to mention the
            desperate need of accountability, motivation, and a peer-group to
            learn alongside. Hence, the journey of my entire life leading to
            this path...the path to Coding Temple. It is here that I will
            complete my training and finally reach my final form as a
            professional Software Engineer / Web Developer / Computer Programmer
            / Coder / why do we have so many names?
